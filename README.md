Hello! This is my first repository, welcome. I am pretty new to programming.
I don't know any languages and my practical experience coding is almost nothing.
But I have always been interested in programming, software engineering, and the
inner workings of computers, and as such I have recently begun learning C.

The textbook: C Programming - A Modern Approach, was recommended as the best
intro to C, and so I have been doing the projects at the end of each chapter.
It is then only natural that I start a github page, in order to document and share
my learning journey, which is the purpose of this page. I hope my code does not dissapoint,
I would be happy to hear from anyone if they have advice, pointers (C what I did there?), or
any other comments relating to my code, or programming/software engineering in general.

Safe travels,
JR
